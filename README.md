# Scout
Scout is one part of microservice that goes out and finds user requested media , downloads it and uploads to a plex server. Also wanted to try my hand at building a 
more complex system and communicate between docker containers.


## Inspriation 
My interest began with discovering about plex and started to wonder what could be done and I wanted to build my own system. Then the idea of having to manually 
add media started to disturb me. I figured I try my hand at automating the process.
